# Enrollment & Payment

{% hint style="success" %}
Those with an existing ExCRS account may skip to Step 3.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1: Create an ExCRS account

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 1a" %}
Sign up for an ExCRS account online at [uplinguistics.com](http://uplinguistics.com/).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 1b" %}
Prepare image files of your <mark style="color:blue;">recent photo</mark> and a <mark style="color:blue;">valid Philippine government-issued ID.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**NOTE:**</mark>

* Only JPG and PNG files less than 2MB are accepted.
  * PDFs and other file formats are NOT accepted.
* You can also opt to take a webcam photo instead of uploading a recent one.
* Undergraduate students may use a school ID or birth certificate instead of a government ID.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 1c" %}
Provide the following information.

1. Name
2. Email
3. Phone number
4. Address
5. Birthdate
6. Sex assigned at birth
7. Occupation
8. Affiliation (school/company/organization; write N/A if unaffiliated)
9. Industry (e.g., education, finance, etc.; choose `OTHERS` if your industry is not available from the options or if unsure which industry you are in)
10. Person to contact in case of emergency with contact details (mobile number preferred)

<mark style="color:blue;">**NOTE:**</mark>

* Please make sure that the information you enter is the same as the one shown on your submitted government ID.
* Double-check your email address as this will be your username and the activation link will be sent there.
  * We encourage using your personal email and not your school or work email to avoid issues related to your affiliation in the future.
* Foreign nationals will be asked to provide a copy of their residence permit or Philippine visa and in the case of UP Diliman exchange students, they may provide a copy of their UPD Form 5 instead.
  * The languages used for instruction are English and/or Filipino.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Note" %}
* <mark style="color:blue;">**To those below 18 years of age**</mark>: Due to the collection of personal information, those below 18 years of age are required to inform their parent/legal guardian that they are creating an ExCRS account.&#x20;
  * We offer Kids & Teens Classes during the Summer (April-May) and Midyear (June-July) terms. Young language learners from age 7 to 16 are advised to enroll in the Kids & Teens Class. In regular extramural classes, students who are below 17 years old may be asked to transfer to another class or cycle.
  * Students who are at least in their senior high may join the regular extramural classes.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**UPD students are still required to create an Extramural Classes Registration System (ExCRS) account**</mark> as this is a separate registration database used by the UP Department of Linguistics for its Extension Program.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## Step 2: Activate your ExCRS account

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 2" %}
Check your email for the activation link from <mark style="color:blue;">extrams.linguistics.upd@up.edu.ph</mark> and activate your account.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Note" %}
* The activation link is sent to your email after a manual review of your account.
  * This may take up to 15 business days depending on the number of requests received so we advise that you create an account days before the start of registration. During the registration period, we process account requests several times each day.
  * Please disable email services such as Boxbe as this will prevent you from receiving the email.
  * Do not forget to check your SPAM folder as the email might have been redirected there.
  * Use the activation link only ONCE and do not use this link to log into your account. You may access your account at [uplinguistics.com](http://uplinguistics.com/) after activation.&#x20;

Send a follow-up email to <mark style="color:blue;">extrams.linguistics.upd@up.edu.ph</mark> if you have not received the activation link after 15 business days (holidays and weekends excluded).&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 3: Reserve a slot

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 3a" %}
During the registration period, log in to your ExCRS account at [uplinguistics.com](http://uplinguistics.com/).

<mark style="color:blue;">**NOTE:**</mark>

* _<mark style="color:blue;">If the class you are enrolling in has a prerequisite</mark>_, please make sure that you have satisfied the prerequisite course/s. If you have not yet completed the prerequisite or its equivalent, you will not be able to reserve a slot.&#x20;
* _<mark style="color:blue;">If you have prior knowledge of the language</mark>_, fill out the self-assessment form at <mark style="color:blue;">bit.ly/extramsplacement</mark> to determine your level and enroll in the appropriate course.&#x20;
* _<mark style="color:blue;">If you already finished the prerequisite course under the Extramural Classes program</mark>_, you do not need to fill in this form.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 3b" %}
Check the list of offered classes and reserve a slot. Upon successful reservation of a slot, the student will be assigned a <mark style="color:blue;">unique reservation code</mark>.

<mark style="color:blue;">**NOTE:**</mark>

* Classes may fill up quickly, so be mindful of the registration start date and time.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Waitlisting" %}
If the class you are attempting to enroll in is already full, you may try to go on the <mark style="color:blue;">waitlist</mark>.

* If a student with a reserved slot cancels their slot or their slot becomes forfeited due to non-payment within two (2) business days, your waitlist rank will either go up or you will be granted a reserved slot if your waitlist rank is Rank 1.
* A maximum of 10 students may join the waitlist and class slots are usually restricted to 20 students (15 students for Kids and Teens classes; note that some instructors may prefer more than 20 students in their class).
* If your status changes from being <mark style="color:blue;">`WAITLISTED`</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">`RESERVED`</mark>, you will receive an email notification.

{% hint style="danger" %}
DO NOT PAY IF YOUR STATUS IS WAITLISTED. PAY ONLY WHEN YOUR STATUS IS RESERVED.

Refund requests will <mark style="color:red;">NOT</mark> be entertained when payment was done and the student has no reserved slot.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
When in doubt, check your ExCRS account to know your registration status.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 4: Download payment slip

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 4" %}
Download the payment slip (a.k.a. billing statement) from your account.

* Go to your <mark style="color:blue;">`MY CLASSES`</mark> page and at the rightmost column, select <mark style="color:blue;">`YEAR`</mark> and click on <mark style="color:blue;">PAYMENT SLIP</mark>.
  * Mobile phone users may need to scroll to the rightmost part of the page to find this option.
  * Note that the <mark style="color:blue;">`PAYMENT SLIP`</mark> button will only appear when you have reserved a slot.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 5: Pay for your slot

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 5a" %}
{% hint style="danger" %}
DO NOT PAY IF YOUR STATUS IS WAITLISTED. PAY ONLY WHEN YOUR STATUS IS RESERVED.

Refund requests will <mark style="color:red;">NOT</mark> be entertained when payment was done and the student has no reserved slot.
{% endhint %}

Pay for your slot within two (2) business days (excluding Quezon City and national holidays and weekends).

* For example, you reserved a slot on a Sunday, the slot will expire at 5 pm on Tuesday.

<mark style="color:blue;">**NOTE:**</mark>
